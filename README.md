# Bahá’í Interlinear Prayers
https://bahai-interlinear-prayers.neocities.org/

I'm learning Arabic/Farsi and want to start performing the long obligatory prayer in Arabic as a way to keep up a daily practice routine. I couldn't find any interliner Bahá’í prayer websites that worked so me, so I'm starting to work on my own. Pull requests are always welcome.
